This is a Pokemon Review Api. In this API I focus mainly on following OOP AND SOLID principles and using the AutoMapper Library.
The API Has models that contain a one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationship.
The API implements the GET, PUSH, PUT AND DELETE requests fro some on the models.
Please dive into the code and give reviews, suggestion and ways to improve the code.
