#This is a Pokemon Review Api. 

In this API I focus mainly on following OOP AND SOLID principles and using the AutoMapper Library.
The API Has models that contain a one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationship.
The API implements the GET, PUSH, PUT AND DELETE requests for some on the models.
I used the Model View Controller(MVC) approach.
##This is an on going project more ideas yet to be implemented
Please dive into the code and give reviews, suggestion and ways to improve the code.
